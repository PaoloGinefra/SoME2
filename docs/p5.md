# Using p5.js in TSX

An example sketch can be found at [src/sketches/Example](../src/sketches/Example.tsx).  
Here's a list of things to mind when creating a sketch:

- Always use the `SketchNext` component from the `components` folder, and not directly the `Sketch` component:  

  ```tsx
  import Sketch from '../components/SketchNext'

  const YourSketch = () => (
    return <Sketch ... />
  )
  ```

- The `Sketch` component accepts a single prop: a function that takes a p5 instace as argument.

- p5 functions are provided as methods of the `p5` argument:
  ```tsx
  return <Sketch
    ... 
    sketchFunction={
      (p5) => { 
        p5.setup = () => { 
          p5.canvas(500, 500)
          ...
        }
        p5.draw = () => { ... }  
      }
    }
  />
  ```

- Classes need to be imported from `window.p5`, which is only available in the DOM, so do it inside p5 methods.

  ```tsx
  return <Sketch 
    sketchFunction={
      (p5) => { 
        p5.setup = () => { 
          const { Vector } = window.p5
        }
      }
    }
  />
  ```

# Using p5.js in TSX

An example sketch can be found at [src/sketches/Example](../src/sketches/Example.tsx).  
Here's a list of things to mind when creating a sketch:

- Always use the `Sketch` component from the `components` folder, and not directly from the `react-p5` library:  

  ```tsx
  import Sketch from '../components/Sketch'

  const YourSketch = () => (
    return <Sketch ... />
  )
  ```

- The `Sketch` component accepts a list of props that correspond to p5's global methods. You can find a list with all the props [here](https://github.com/Gherciu/react-p5#props).

- p5 functions are provided as methods of the `p5` argument:
  ```tsx
  return <Sketch
    ... 
    draw={
      (p5) => { p5.background(...) }
    }
  />
  ```

- In `setup`, remember to set the canvas parent:

  ```tsx
  return <Sketch 
    setup={
      (p5, parentRef) => {
        p5.createCanvas(...).parent(parentRef)
      }
    }
  />
  ```

- Classes need to be imported from `window.p5`, which is only available in the DOM, so do it inside p5 methods.

  ```tsx
  return <Sketch 
    setup={
      (p5, parentRef) => {
        const { Vector } = window.p5
      }
    }
  />
  ```

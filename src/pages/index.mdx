## An adventurous mathematician

One day Avraham, an intrepid maths enthusiast, decided to give a go at cryptocurrencies.
He knew that he wasn't cut out for trading so he wanted to try mining instead.
Little did he know that he was taking it a bit too literally...\
He geared up and went into the so called "flatland mine" (which earned this title thanks to its spanning only on a single vertical plane)\
Avraham may be impulsive but surely he is not unwary so he made sure to bring a map of the mine with him.\
We all know how mathematichians are... while looking for a bitcoin Avraham got caught up in his thoughts:
thinking about a problem he was facing the day before he got lost.\
A brief moment of panic followed but then, under his glasses, his eyes flashed with a frenzied glee.
He was now part of one of the problems he so loved to solve.\
A quick glance at the map was enough to realize that he could not pin point his location,
it was too dark and the mine's corridors all looked the same, it was impossible to find a reference point.

### CANVAS CON MOVIMENTO NON AUTOMATICO

The next natural step was to clearly identify what was he looking for.\
He figured that he needed to choose what to do only at the crossroads, because he could just follow streight corridors and go back if he found a dead end.\
So he needed a set of instructions (which told him whether to go Up, Down, Left or Right at the crossroads) that would lead him to the exit no metter his location.

A bunch of questions naturally started to float around in Avraham's mind:

- Does such a set even exist?
- Is there a way to find it quickly?
- How many instructions would the smallest one contain at best? and at worst?

### CANVAS CON MOVIMENTO AUTOMATICO

Avrham then sat down and began to ponder, scribbling on the mine's dusty walls.
After a while (he quickly lost track of time) he shouted: 'EUREKA!!! I need to follow UULDL'.

## An orientation problem fair and square
The year is 2122, the world has evolved in unimaginable ways: deadly diseases are a thing of the past,
the usage of metal straws insted of plastic ones managed to save the enviroment and the Riemann hypothesis has been proven
for a couple of years now. But above all of that, LEGO finally decided to launch its firtst full scale car model.
Obviously, LEGO being LEGO, the factory of said cars had to be built entirely using legos... something about brand identity.

Unfortunatly, a new way to move objects in a straight line hasn't been found yet, conveyor belts are still the state of the art.
Not only that, but a series of poorly made decisions (some of them regarding hibernation) has led you to be
in charge of designing said contraptions for the LEGO car company.

Today you are tackling a peculiar situation:\
The last step to completing a car is to attach the roof. There are two conveyor belts perpendicular to each other,
one for the almost-finished cars and the other for the roofs. The problem is that roofs can come in four different orientations
but only one of them fits the car!

### PICTURE WITH THE ORIENTATIONS

Your job is to design a setup to orient the pieces in the right way. Oviously you can use lego bricks only, so no sensors, no motors, nothing like that.
Only passive solutions are allowed. Studing the shape of the roof you arrive at the conclusion that placing a series of briks in just one of two vertical positions
should be enough to rotate the pieces form any orietation to every other.

### CANVAS WITH JUST ONE BRICK TO TEST AT FIRST, AND THE POSSIBILITY TO ADD

Now the big problem is to find the right series. You try to solve the problem on your own but after a while you give up.
So you try a quick browser search (obviously using your mind) and you find an old paper that seems to give you all the answers.
The name of the author strucks you for being quite unusual. You really can't think about anybody else named Avrham.
Anyway, you try using the suggested algorithm and find the sequence "01010100101"

    ## What's behind the trick

    The findings of Avraham and future you almost resemble a magic trick. In fact
    something like this has been used in several ones.
    The ability to follow a set of instructions just to end up in the same
    configuration, no matter the starting one, is not only mind blowing but also
    hella useful. You may be surprised to know that this is a mathematical concept
    that has been studied for over half a centuary now and that it even has some problems still left unsolved.
    Let's dive a little deeper...

    ### The beauty of Automata / Time to abstract

    So, as we have just seen, the "trick" works in a wide variety of situations so, in a truly mathematical fashion, we need
    to use the power of abstraction to factor out all the scenario specific differences so as just to focus on the common part.

    First of all we can call the crossroads / roofs orientations / configurations "States" and the instructions to move between them "Transitions".

    In both the examples is clear that after reaching a state you are presented with a choice, you could either go Up, Down, Left or Right in the maze
    or choose the Green or Red brick for the legos. It's natural to identify transitions with symbols like U,D,L,R or G and R or 0,1,2,3 and so on.
    Now try and think of the last sequence of symbols you used to convey some sort of meaning... a word. That's how a sequence of instructions is called.

    Now, if we associate every symbol with a color, we can draw every state as a node and every transition as a colored arrow between nodes.
    We have now rappresented our setup as a directed graph.

    ### CANVAS WITH GRAPH

    Not only that, but now given a starting state and a word we can easily compute the landing state.

    ### AUTOMABOT DEMO

    So let's recap, we have constructed a not so black box that can take in a set of instructions, a word, and spits out a result.
    Doesn't it sounds even a little familiar? Careful because this time the answer is litterally before your eyes: a Computer!


    Well not quite, it's an abstract computer, a mathematical one. An automaton!

    Now try and execute the same word from the same starting state twice, do you expect the results to change?
    I mean it would be a problem if it did: if you ask your calculator what 2+2 is, you'd want the answer not to change every time, wouldn't you?
    These kind of processes are called deterministic.
    Furthermore, in this case the number of possible states has a limit, it's finite.

    We have built a **Deterministic Finite Automaton** also known as a DFA.

## Math (with $\KaTeX$)

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L

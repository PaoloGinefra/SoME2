# All roads lead to Rome, a colorful problem

## Math (with $\KaTeX$)

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

## An adventurous mathematician

One day Avraham, an intrepid maths enthusiast, decided to give a go at cryptocurrencies.
He knew that he wasn't cut out for trading so he wanted to try mining instead.
Little did he know that he was taking it a bit too literally...\
He geared up and went into the so called "flatland mine" (which earned this title thanks to its spanning only on a single vertical plane)\
Avraham may be impulsive but surely he is not unwary so he made sure to bring a map of the mine with him.\
We all know how mathematichians are... while looking for a bitcoin Avraham got caught up in his thoughts:
thinking about a problem he was facing the day before he got lost.\
A brief moment of panic followed but then, under his glasses, his eyes flashed with a frenzied glee.
He was now part of one of the problems he so loved to solve.\
A quick glance at the map was enough to realize that he could not pin point his location,
it was too dark and the mine's corridors all looked the same, it was impossible to find a reference point.

### CANVAS CON MOVIMENTO NON AUTOMATICO

The next natural step was to clearly identify what was he looking for.\
He figured that he needed to choose what to do only at the crossroads, because he could just follow streight corridors and go back if he found a dead end.\
So he needed a set of instructions (which told him whether to go Up, Down, Left or Right at the crossroads) that would lead him to the exit no metter his location.

A bunch of questions naturally started to float around in Avraham's mind:

- Does such a set even exist?
- Is there a way to find it quickly?
- How many instructions would the smallest one contain at best? and at worst?

### CANVAS CON MOVIMENTO AUTOMATICO

Avrham then sat down and began to ponder, scribbling on the mine's dusty walls.
After a while (he quickly lost track of time) he shouted: 'EUREKA!!! I need to follow UULDL'.

## An orientation problem fair and square
The year is 2122, the world has evolved in unimaginable ways: deadly diseases are a thing of the past,
the usage of metal straws insted of plastic ones managed to save the enviroment and the Riemann hypothesis has been proven
for a couple of years now. But above all of that, LEGO finally decided to launch its firtst full scale car model.
Obviously, LEGO being LEGO, the factory of said cars had to be built entirely using legos... something about brand identity.

Unfortunatly, a new way to move objects in a straight line hasn't been found yet, conveyor belts are still the state of the art.
Not only that, but a series of poorly made decisions (some of them regarding hibernation) has led you to be
in charge of designing said contaptions for the LEGO car company.

Today you are tackling a peculiar situation:\
The last step to completing a car is to attach the roof. There are two conveyor belts perpendicular to each other,
one for the almost-finished cars and the other for the roofs. The problem is that roofs can come in four different orientations
but only one of them fits the car!

### PICTURE WITH THE ORIENTATIONS

Your job is to design a setup to orient the pieces in the right way. Oviously you can use only lego bricks so no sensors, no motors, nothing like that.
Only passive solutions are allowed. Studing the shape of the roof you arrive at a conclusion that placing a series of briks in just one of two vertical positions
should be enough to rotate the pieces form any orietation to every other orientation.

### CANVAS WITH JUST ONE BRICK TO TEST AT FIRST, AND THE POSSIBILITY TO ADD

Now the big problem is to find the right series. You try to solve the problem on your own but after a while you give up.
So you try a quick browser search (obviously using your mind) and you find an old paper that seems to give you all the answers.
The name of the author strucks you for being quite unusual. You really can't think about anybody else named Avrham.
Anyway, you try using the suggested algorithm and find the sequence "01010100101"

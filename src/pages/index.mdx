## Math (with $\KaTeX$)

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

## An adventurous mathematician

One day Avraham, an intrepid maths enthusiast, decided to give a go at cryptocurrencies.
He knew that he wasn't cut out for trading so he wanted to try mining instead.
Little did he know that he was taking it a bit too literally...\
He geared up and went into the so called "flatland mine" (which earned this title thanks to its spanning only on a single vertical plane)\
Avraham may be impulsive but surely he is not unwary so he made sure to bring a map of the mine with him.\
We all know how mathematichians are... while looking for a bitcoin Avraham got caught up in his thoughts:
thinking about a problem he was facing the day before he got lost.\
A brief moment of panic followed but then, under his glasses, his eyes flashed with a frenzied glee.
He was now part of one of the problems he so loved to solve.\
A quick glance at the map was enough to realize that he could not pin point his location,
it was too dark and the mine's corridors all looked the same, it was impossible to find a reference point.

### CANVAS CON MOVIMENTO NON AUTOMATICO

The next natural step was to clearly identify what was he looking for.\
He figured that he needed to choose what to do only at the crossroads, because he could just follow streight corridors and go back if he found a dead end.\
So he needed a set of instructions (which told him whether to go Up, Down, Left or Right at the crossroads) that would lead him to the exit no metter his location.

A bunch of questions naturally started to float around in Avraham's mind:

- Does such a set even exist?
- Is there a way to find it quickly?
- How many instructions would the smallest one contain at best? and at worst?

### CANVAS CON MOVIMENTO AUTOMATICO

Avrham then sat down and began to ponder, scribbling on the mine's dusty walls.
After a while (he quickly lost track of time) he shouted: 'EUREKA!!! I need to follow UULDL'.
